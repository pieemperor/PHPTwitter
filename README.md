# PHP Twitter

This project was the final project for my Server Side Web Programming class. 

This project was to create a clone of Twitter just using PHP.  The different functions are separated out into different PHP files. It also works with session variables to keep track of if the user is logged in and similar information.  To see this project in action, visit http://einstein.etsu.edu/~cowelld/projects/project2/
